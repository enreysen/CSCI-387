# CSCI-387
This repository contains the final project for my CSCI 387 Software Development course, which focused on full-stack web application development.

As part of a four-person team, we developed a web-based Event Management System for the University of Mississippi. The application includes both front-end and back-end components and allows general users to view and sign up for university-related events, and for event managers to create, edit, and delete events. 

To access the application, visit the website https://events.rbmyres.com/
